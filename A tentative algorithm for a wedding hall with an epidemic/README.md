A tentative algorithm for a wedding hall with an epidemic

Algorithm:
1 - Initially the wedding invitation cards will be distributed to the attendees, they will contain the Bluetooth beacon model in beautiful and small shape. ( It is possible to save costs by programming an application on their phones that uses Bluetooth)

2 - We distribute sensors for identification within the hall, and they are circular and depicted in directions.

3 - Everywhere contains pieces of recognition, we will put a light RGB light and lighting, let us make it by default a certain color such as white and speaker with a sharp vibrating voice, but does not affect the atmosphere of the hall.

4 - We program a system via microcontrollers if two Bluetooth IDs are specified next to each (mac address) which will send an alert to the corner speakers and the lighting glows red in this corner to get away from each other.

5 - After people move away from each other, it can glow blue or green, then return white or according to the specified default color suitable for the newlyweds.
